		<p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Phonetic Classic was a 'face-off' in the most literal sense of the term. An opportunity for the typographically minded of Chicago to declare and crown the ultimate character of the alphabet. An interactive display and mobile responsive website were developed to give the community a chance to vote for their favorite three characters, thereby giving a 'reasonably' accurate portrayal of jusst how loved each letter is by the masses attending Typeforce. <a href="http://phoneticclassic.com/" target="_blank">Launch the site &raquo;</a></p>
